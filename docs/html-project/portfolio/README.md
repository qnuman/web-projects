## Project Overview

The portfolio website is divided into multiple pages, each serving a unique purpose:

- **Homepage**: The introduction to the website, providing an overview of my work and purpose.
- **Projects**: A page where I highlight key projects I’ve worked on, detailing the technologies and skills I applied.
- **Articles**: A collection of articles I’ve written or contributed to, sharing insights and knowledge.
- **Contact**: A contact page where users can reach out via a form.

## Key Features

- **Navigation**: A persistent navigation bar is available across all pages, providing easy access to the main sections: Homepage, Projects, Articles, and Contact.
- **Semantic HTML**: I focused on using semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`) to ensure the website is well-structured, accessible, and SEO-friendly.
- **SEO Meta Tags**: Each page includes relevant SEO meta tags in the `<head>` section to optimize visibility in search engines.
- **Contact Form**: The Contact page includes a form with fields like name, email, and message, enabling users to send direct messages.

## Project Goals

1. **Multiple Pages**: Develop a multi-page website to showcase various sections of my portfolio.
2. **Semantic HTML Structure**: Emphasize accessibility and SEO through semantic HTML elements.
3. **Future Styling**: Lay the groundwork for future CSS styling, ensuring that the site remains scalable and easy to maintain.
4. **Basic SEO**: Implement basic SEO strategies through meta tags for better discoverability.

## Pages Breakdown

- **Homepage**: The main landing page, featuring a brief introduction and links to all sections.

- **Articles**: A curated list of articles and blog posts that I have written, focusing on my technical and professional experiences.

## Conclusion

This **HTML-only portfolio** provides a solid foundation for my work, skills, and experiences. While it’s currently styled with basic HTML structure, it is designed to be easily enhanced with CSS for a more polished and visually appealing presentation in the future. This project is part of my ongoing journey in web development, with the goal of continually improving both my technical skills and the presentation of my work.
